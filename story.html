                       "Once upon a time, in a lush jungle filled with all kinds of animals, there lived a baby elephant named Edgar. Edgar was a curious and playful little elephant who loved to explore his surroundings and make new friends. He would often roam around the jungle, looking for adventure and excitement. One day, while exploring the jungle, Edgar stumbled upon a group of monkeys playing in the tree branch. Fascinated by their acrobatic skills, Edgar wanted to join in the fun. The monkeys welcomed him with open arms and taught him how to swing from branch to branch. Edgar was thrilled and spent hours playing with his new friends.   ",

But on his way back, Edgar got lost. He didn’t know which direction to take and began to feel scared and alone. Just when he thought he was lost forever, he heard a familiar sound. It was his mother’s trumpet call. Edgar followed the sound and soon found himself back with his family.

                       "A <span style='color:blue'>consonant blend</span> is when two or three consonants are right next door to each other and each gives its sound.<br><br> In other words, each sound is still pronounced separately. For example, the word “spin” has a consonant blend of /s/ and /p/.<br>Let’s take examples of two consonant sounds that make an initial consonant blend:<br><br>/bl/ as in black, blow, and blind<br> /kl/ as in clean, clap, and clock <br>/fl/ as in flower, fly, and floor<br>",
